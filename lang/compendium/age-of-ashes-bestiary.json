Their oversized eyes give them keen vision in both light and dark, and their large toes allow them to easily scale the trees atop which they reside. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, their physiologies largely determined by their surrounding environment; those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis are just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.</p>\n<p>Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't raise crops in the traditional sense, although they do cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. The jungle also contains rivers and lakes filled with silver-scaled fish, which gripplis harvest in a sustainable manner to ensure their future supply, as well as fatty insects that grow much larger than in other parts of the world. Some of the most advanced grippli societies capture and breed these insects, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that are eventually slaughtered for food for the rest of the village. Particularly enterprising gripplis even seek out and tame huge flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.</p>\n<p>The treetop settlements of the grippli are difficult to spot from the forest floor. Gripplis obscure their holdings with broad leaves and thick branches, and they riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they know how to navigate. Their villages are usually constructed among the densest populations of trees, with thin rope bridges strung between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk.</p>\n<p>These sharpshooters are renowned for their patience and their accuracy.</p>",

Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares.

Their oversized eyes give them keen vision in both light and dark, and their large toes allow them to easily scale the trees atop which they reside. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, their physiologies largely determined by their surrounding environment; those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis are just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.</p>\n<p>Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't raise crops in the traditional sense, although they do cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. The jungle also contains rivers and lakes filled with silver-scaled fish, which gripplis harvest in a sustainable manner to ensure their future supply, as well as fatty insects that grow much larger than in other parts of the world. Some of the most advanced grippli societies capture and breed these insects, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that are eventually slaughtered for food for the rest of the village. Particularly enterprising gripplis even seek out and tame huge flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.</p>\n<p>The treetop settlements of the grippli are difficult to spot from the forest floor. Gripplis obscure their holdings with broad leaves and thick branches, and they riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they know how to navigate. Their villages are usually constructed among the densest populations of trees, with thin rope bridges strung between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk.</p>\n<p>The unofficial healers of gripplikind are known as greenspeakers.</p>",

As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.</p>\n<p>Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>",

When the legion spotted this 6-foot-long bird with its spectacular multicolored feathers trailing from its tail, wings, and crest, the soldiers thought the bird regal enough to suit their emperor, disregarding the name the Mwangi had given to the bird generations before, bebaki.</p>\n<p>Keeping an emperor bird was, for many years, a sign of prestige among the nobility of Taldor. That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest.</p>\n<p>The emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators.
